# Pathfinding Visualization Game for Adv CS AB Final Project
## created by Oscar Lauth
### A note about pathfinding algorithms
#### This project utilizes 4 different pathfinding algorithms: Breadth-First Search, Depth First Search, Dijkstra, and A*
##### An algorithm is said to be complete if it can always find a path, if it exists
##### An algorithm is said to be optimal if it can find the optimal shortest path
##### -DFS is complete but not optimal
##### -BFS is complete but only optimal when the cost of moving to all neighboring nodes is equal (diagonal = straight)
##### -Dijkstra is complete and optimal
##### -A* is complete and optimal
